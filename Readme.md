# About
Diet Trackr is a diet companion website that helps users monitor their nutrition intake and make healthier eating habits.

When a user enters a food item into the meal tracker, Diet Trackr will automatically look up nutrition info and log the change in the user's profile. It features data visualization using SVG and a recipe lookup page that will select random recipes based on a variety of filters, such as dietary or calorie restrictions.

# Features
